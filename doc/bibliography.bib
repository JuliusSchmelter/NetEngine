  abstract = {This paper is aimed at analysing the levelised cost of energy (LCOE) of onshore wind turbine generators (WTGs) that are in operation beyond their design lifetime. In order to do so, the LCOE approach is introduced and input parameters are discussed for a UK deployment. In addition, a methodology is presented to support economic lifetime extension and investment decision making at the end of an asset's design lifetime. As part of a case study, a wind farm consisting of six 900 kW WTGs is subjected to different combinations of i) lifetime extension (5–15 years), ii) input assumptions (pessimistic, central, optimistic), and iii) reinvestment types (retrofits). Results indicate that in the central lifetime extension scenario, LCOE estimates of 22.40 £/MWh are achievable.}

  abstract = {A significant number of wind turbines will reach the end of their planned service life in the near future. A decision on lifetime extension is complex and experiences to date are limited. This review presents the current state-of-the-art for lifetime extension of onshore wind turbines in Germany, Spain, Denmark, and the UK. Information was gathered through a literature review and 24 guideline-based interviews with key market players. Technical, economic and legal aspects are discussed. Results indicate that end-of-life solutions will develop a significant market over the next five years. The application of updated load simulation and inspections for technical lifetime extension assessment differs between countries. A major concern is the uncertainty about future electricity spot market prices, which determine if lifetime extension is economically feasible.}
